Your new app is now ready for development!

Here's what you should do next:

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [installed Harper](https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/deployments/install-harper):

```sh
npm install -g harper
```

## Development

Then you can start your app:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Define Your Schema

1. Create a new yourTableName.graphql file in the [schemas](./schemas) directory.
2. Craft your schema by hand.
3. Save your changes.

These schemas are the heart of a great Harper app, specifying which tables you want and what attributes/fields they should have. Any table you `@export` stands up [endpoints automatically](./.agents/skills/harper-best-practices/rules/automatic-apis.md).

### Add Custom Endpoints

1. Create a new greeting.js file in the [resources](./resources) directory.

2. Customize your resource:

   ```javascript
   export class Greeting extends Resource {
   	static loadAsInstance = false;

   	async post(
   		target,
   		newRecord,
   	) {
   		// By default, only super users can access these endpoints.
   		return { greeting: 'Greetings, post!' };
   	}

   	async get(target) {
   		// But if we want anyone to be able to access it, we can turn off the permission checks!
   		target.checkPermission = false;
   		return { greeting: 'Greetings, get! ' + process.version };
   	}

   	async put(
   		target,
   		record,
   	) {
   		target.checkPermission = false;
   		if (this.getCurrentUser()?.name?.includes('Coffee')) {
   			// You can add your own authorization guards, of course.
   			return new Response('Coffee? COFFEE?!', { status: 418 });
   		}
   		return { greeting: 'Sssssssssssssss!' };
   	}

   	async patch(
   		target,
   		record,
   	) {
   		return { greeting: 'We can make this work!' };
   	}

   	async delete(target) {
   		return true;
   	}
   }
   ```

3. Save your changes.

### View Your Website

Pop open [http://localhost:9926](http://localhost:9926) to view [web/index.html](./web/index.html) in your browser.

### Use Your API

Test your application works by querying the `/Greeting` endpoint:

```sh
curl http://localhost:9926/Greeting
```

You should see the following:

```json
{ "greeting": "Hello, world!" }
```

### Configure Your App

Take a look at the [default configuration](./config.yaml), which specifies how files are handled in your application.

## Deployment

When you are ready, head to [https://fabric.harper.fast/](https://fabric.harper.fast/), log in to your account, and create a cluster.

Come back here and configure your [.env](./.env) file with your secure cluster credentials. Don't commit this file to source control!

Then you can deploy your app to your cluster:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

## Keep Going!
